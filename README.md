# ODX
ODX (Orderbook Decentralized Exchange) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that originated from a hackathon event. Powered by Cartesi's rollup technology, ODX executes order matching on-chain, creating a fully decentralized orderbook. This paper explores ODX's hackathon roots and highlights the key benefits of Cartesi's rollup for decentralized trading.
